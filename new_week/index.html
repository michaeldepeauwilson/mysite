			<p>My favorite movies are those that show how a life can be lived in unusual or extrodinary times. I think that is way I have loved The Shawshank Redemption from the first time that I watched it. It tells a story of several men that are forced into a life that they couldn't be prepared for in anyway. Still, those men find their own ways to survive and even, at times, flourished. I also love the redemption of the story, and I think it is made better because you know it is coming from the title. When it does come though it is still an inspiring moment. </p>

			<p>I love the wandering and ever seeking style of Brad Pitt's character in this movie about life during the first world war and the tumultuous years that followed it. I also felt the connection with Julia Ormond's character as she suffered through the pains of love and absence of the person she cared so much about. The movie gives room for all the characters to experience a wide range of emotions which drew me into a story that ends in a powerful way. It also has an incredible backdrop to go with the stoires.</p>

			<p>Brad Pitt in another frontier lifestyle movie. It is an excellent and slowly told story showing how life for two young brothers can change over time. Brad Pitt plays another wandering young man that gets himself into trouble. The relationship between the father, Tom Skerritt, and the sons, Pitt and Craig Sheffer, is full of tension and compassion that I think is relatable for any father and son. The dad wants what is best for the son and the son can't hear his father's advice in enough time. It is a great story about growning in a changing country and how the family copes with personal challenges.</p>

			<p>I am not sure what else can be said about the defining movement of The Matrix. It feels like it changed the standards and desires of audiences for action-sci-fi movies. Keanu Reeves, Carrie-anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne captured lighting in a bottle with the mindbending story of disception and rebellion. It is a simple enough retelling of the Allegory of the Cave, but it packs a bag of kung fu punches. I love the action, but the story of coming out of the darkness and into the light of truth is what I love this movie. It feeds a universal fear of not knowing the truth about the world we live in everyday.</p>

			<p>This is a much different movie in many ways, but the core of it is a family dealing with unique circumstances. The acting is subtle and perfect for the story of a man who inherits the ability to go back in time. Bill Nighy and Domhnall Gleeson have incredible chemistry as father and son. Rachel McAdams in a grounding force giving the entire adventure a real sincerity. Her relationship with Gleeson makes me believe the struggles and the desires of Gleeson's character, and the action he attempts give his family everything they need to be happy. The final message is that a man or woman will still use whatever powers, however extrodinary it is, to make their family happy. I love the message and the honest performances that devliver it.</p>

			<p>I fell in love with this ridiculous buddy cop movie at the beginning twist that leads The Rock and Samuel Jackson to an early exit. I am a huge fan of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg does an amazing job matching his energy. In addition to constant flow of slapsticking, lighthearted performances are delivered with great timing by Eva Mendes and Michael Keaton. It is a fun movie that allows the audience to sit back and soak it in. </p>
